It’s unintimidating and it barely even passes as a playground. Sandwiched between the tennis courts and the field, there are two baby swings, a bench and two spring riders. Pop that baby into the baby swing and you’ll feel golden as you realize your baby likes swinging back and forth and but can’t escape, making it the first time since birth that you can feel some sort of freedom. At least, I’m hoping that’s what happens for you, you superstar caregiver that’s sustaining life as we speak. There are some hilly areas and big rocks to balance on for the toddlers and a pretty great tree to climb up for the older kids. Personally I think the highlight of this park are the chestnuts that litter the northside of the field during the fall, which for kids is like finding a bounty of treasure.",

It comes complete with a plastic tunnel slide, a wide metal slide, a hanging bridge, chain link ladder and a rare, square shaped tunnel. From the top platform, children can enjoy seeing barges and tugboats chugging along the Fraser River with log booms in tow. Pea gravel lies below with surprises of little acorns and twigs, creating some tactile play for little ones.",

This brightly coloured play space has a fun slanted window for little ones to peek out of and a couple of spinners to get as dizzy as one pleases. Right beside it is a free library of artsy books and a garden path with lots of big rocks and dirt for kids to practice their balance, coordination and mudpie making skills.",
